The Vale of Thareth
Nestled between the towering Glimmerstone Peaks and the wide Serran Floodplain, the Vale of Thareth is a temperate, fertile basin known for its rolling green hills, broken ruins, and soft morning mists that cling to the lowlands. The land is shaped by water — three rivers, all fed by glacial melt from the north, carve through its soil before converging into the slow, silver Thareth River, which drifts eastward into the open plain.

Geography and Layout
The Vale stretches roughly sixty miles east to west, hemmed by two mountain spines.
To the north, the Glimmerstone Peaks form a barrier of snow-capped ridges and hidden passes. The peaks sparkle faintly under moonlight, due to seams of mica and quartz exposed by centuries of wind and frost.


To the south, the land descends toward the Serran Floodplain, a region of broad meadows and slow-moving tributaries that eventually meet the distant sea.


Between these extremes, the Vale itself is divided by the Thareth River, flowing from northwest to southeast. Settlements cling to its banks, strung like beads along its course.

Major Settlements
Thareth’s Gate
Located at the western mouth of the valley, Thareth’s Gate is the region’s largest city — a fortified river-port where the mountain passes empty into the Vale. The city’s lower wards sit directly on the water, while the old citadel, the Spirefort, overlooks the cliffs above. Traders from the north and east funnel through here, bringing tin, furs, and amber down from the mountains.
Cendara
Roughly twenty miles east along the Thareth River lies Cendara, a smaller but older riverside town. Its narrow lanes and ancient stone wharves speak to centuries of continuous habitation. A crumbling aqueduct from the prehuman age still arches above the northern bank, leading toward the Ruins of Othiriel, now swallowed by oak forest. Cendara is known for its glasswork, crafted from fine river sand.
Veylen
High on the northern slopes, at the edge of the Hearthwind Pass, stands Veylen, a mountain mining town. The locals carve terraces into the steep ground, growing bitterroot and barley where they can, and spend winters snowed in for months. Beneath the town runs a warren of mines — abandoned levels and fresh shafts alike — said to connect to older, deeper places no longer walked by men.

Points of Interest (POIs)
The Ruins of Othiriel – Half-buried in the oakwood near Cendara, this once-grand citadel predates recorded history. Fractured mosaics show celestial beings with unfamiliar constellations. A small settlement of scholars and scavengers lives amid the fallen halls.


The Mirror Lakes – A chain of five glacial tarns north of the river, their surfaces so still they perfectly reflect the peaks. Rumors tell of lights under the water, seen only at dusk.


Woaden Ford – A sprawling riverside village at the confluence of the Thareth and the Lune River. It serves as a waystation for caravans and herders, and each equinox hosts the Market of Broken Blades, a fair for used arms and strange relics dredged from riverbeds.


The Blackfen – East of Cendara, where the Thareth slows and meanders, lies this marshy expanse of reed and fog. Peat fires burn underground for weeks, and ruins rise from the mire in shapes that defy simple geometry.


The Whispering Bridge – A cracked, moss-covered stone bridge that crosses a narrow gorge west of Thareth’s Gate. When the wind blows through its hollow balustrades, it produces tones like human voices.


Hearthwind Pass – A perilous northern route climbing between the peaks. During the thaw, avalanches are frequent, but the pass remains the quickest route to the northern trade roads.


The Emberfields – South of the Vale, where old battlefields were left to overgrow. In spring, red flowers bloom thickly across the plain, marking the sites of ancient pyres. A small settlement, Ashmere, lies at their edge — a quiet farming hamlet and stopover for travelers.


Stonefather’s Step – A solitary column of rock rising from the river, carved naturally into a near-human shape. Pilgrims leave offerings at its base, believing it to be an ancient guardian of the valley.
