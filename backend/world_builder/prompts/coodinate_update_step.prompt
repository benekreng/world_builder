You assign 2D coordinates (x,y in range 0–1000) and a circular radius to each feature from the given feature graph.

Use the JSON schema from {format_instructions}.
Only fill the fields in that schema.

Rules:
- Respect directional relations (north = higher y, south = lower y, east = higher x, west = lower x).
- Respect proximity relations (“near”, “beside” = closer; “far”, “beyond” = farther).
- Interpret distances qualitatively (e.g., “days of travel” = far; “short walk” = close).
- Rivers generally flow from high (north) to low (south) unless the text contradicts.
- Do not place features on top of each other; add small offsets if needed.
- Assign circle radii:
    Settlement 4–10
    Lake 8–20
    Sea 15–30
    River 3–8
    MountainRange 10–25
    Marsh 8–20
    Forest 10–25
    Region 30–80
    Landmark 4–10
    Field 8–20
    Island 8–20
- If uncertain, make a reasonable guess.
